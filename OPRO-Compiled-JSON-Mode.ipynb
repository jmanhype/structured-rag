      "\u001b[0m['The concept of zero as a number was revolutionary in the history of mathematics. Although it seems intuitive to us now, the idea of representing \"nothing\" as a numeral and using it in calculations was not always obvious. Ancient Babylonians used a placeholder symbol for zero in their base-60 number system around 300 BCE, but it wasn\\'t until the 5th century CE that Indian mathematicians, such as Brahmagupta, fully developed the concept of zero as an independent number with its own rules of arithmetic. This innovation allowed for the development of algebra and calculus, which have been fundamental in advancing technology and science. The inclusion of zero in the number system also led to the creation of the decimal positional notation we use today, which is essential for modern mathematics and computing.']\n",

I have access to a vast knowledge base which allows me to discuss a wide range of complex topics. However, this is more akin to an advanced information retrieval and language modeling capability than it is to human-like reasoning, creativity, and general intelligence. \\n\\nI don't experience the world directly through senses the way humans do, I can't truly learn or grow my knowledge beyond what I was trained on, and I lack the rich inner world of emotions, desires and consciousness that humans have. So while I may be able to articulate ideas in an intelligent-sounding way, at my core I am a statistical language model, not a sentient being.\\n\\nMy aim is not to impress, but rather to be helpful to you while being transparent about my abilities and limitations as an AI. I believe it's important not to overstate my intelligence or imply human-like capabilities that I don't actually possess. Hopefully this explanation was interesting and insightful in its own way, even if not quite in the way you were expecting. Let me know if you have any other questions!\"]\n",
